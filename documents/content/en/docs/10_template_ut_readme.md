- [ ] This document meets the specified [template]() requirements
- [ ] The API provided by Env does not contain any DUT pins or timing information
- [ ] The API of Env remains stable (total [ X ])
- [ ] Supported RTL versions in Env have been checked (supported versions [ X ])
- [ ] Function points (total [ X ]) are consistent with the [design document]()
- [ ] Checkpoints (total [ X ]) cover all function points
- [ ] The input of checkpoints does not depend on any DUT pins, only on the standard API of Env
- [ ] All test cases (total [ X ]) are mapped to function checkpoints
- [ ] All test cases use assert for result checking
- [ ] All DUTs or corresponding wrappers are created via fixture
- [ ] RTL version is checked in the above fixtures
- [ ] The fixture for creating DUT or corresponding wrapper performs function and code line coverage statistics
- [ ] Filtering requirements are checked when setting code line coverage
