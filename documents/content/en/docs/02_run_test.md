This project uses the PyTest testing framework for verification. When running tests, the PyTest framework automatically searches for all `test_*.py` files and executes all test cases that start with `test_`.

```bash
# Run all test cases in ut_* directories
make test_all
# Run test cases in the specified directory
make test target=<dir>
# For example, run all test cases in the ut_backend/ctrl_block/decode directory
make test target=ut_backend/ctrl_block/decode
```

You can pass Pytest runtime parameters via the `args` parameter, such as enabling the x-dist plugin for multi-core execution:

```bash
make test args="-n 4"     # Use 4 processes
make test args="-n auto"  # Let the framework automatically choose the number of processes
```

*Note: x-dist can run tests concurrently on multiple nodes. See its [documentation](https://pytest-xdist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/remote.html) for details.

After running, an HTML version of the test report will be generated by default in the `out/report` directory. The HTML file can be opened directly in a browser (it is recommended to install the `Open In Default Browser` plugin in VS Code IDE).

Running tests mainly completes the following three parts:

1. Run Test Cases as required, which can be configured via options in `cfg.tests`
1. Collect test results and output test reports. The toffee-report tool automatically generates (a total test report, merging results of all tests)
1. Further data statistics on the test report as needed (`cfg.doc_result.disable = True`)
